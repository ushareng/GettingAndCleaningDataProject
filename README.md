Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The project tests the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Project contains a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average
 of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output of this project is a text file tidy.txt

It also contains a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
